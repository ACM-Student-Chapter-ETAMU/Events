## ❓ Q&A  

1. If I am planning to graduate in Spring 2026, when should I start applying?  
2. Can you please share the tech stack you are using?  
3. Thank you for sharing your experiences. I was just wondering if you were an international student, and if yes, were there any hardships as one?  
4. As an international student, how do you look for companies that accept OPT?  
5. Do you have previous experience? Does your work focus on full stack web development or Machine Learning development?  
6. I’m planning to start a certification in any cloud. Which cloud would you suggest — AWS, Salesforce, etc.?  
7. What do you suggest for a Machine Learning developer to learn about backend development?  
8. Did you do any internship job before graduating or get a full-time job directly? Most jobs nowadays are internships, and it seems that there are not many graduate jobs. Is an internship necessary, or will there be more graduate jobs around graduation?  
9. Can you share a turning point that shaped your path or perspective?  
10. How many GitHub projects have you done so far?  
11. Is it LeetCode Blind 75? What are your thoughts on Neetcode 150?
